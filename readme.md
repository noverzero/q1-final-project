## Backround (for both proposals)

Bus to Show (BTS) is a nonprofit that organizes thousands of bus trips each year in an effort to prevent impaired driving and fuel consumption that may otherwise result from concerts and other events.

In order to ride the bus, individuals must visit the bus to show website, and register for seats on a bus to their event of choice, from their location of choice.  Event management is currently handled using a third-party ticketing service called eventbrite.

## Project Proposal A

Description:

The BTS Fuel Savings Calculator:

This project will pull live data from the BTS eventbrite account via Eventbrite's API and use it to calculate fuel savings for each event in comparison with fuel consumption of the same number of riders if they had traveled in cars instead.

Note: in the event that API is not implemented in time, the MVP will use manually provided data which can be downloaded from the company's eventbrite account.

Local Storage will be used to save user name, personal vehicle capacity and fuel economy details, which could be transferred between pages.

* Problem Solved: quantifies mission success and encourages ridership among mission supporters
* Users: Bus to Show Website visitors (potential bus rider and sponsors)
* Technologies used:
HTML: Document structure
Framework: Bootstrap
CSS: Bootstrap overrides
Javascript: calculate fuel savings, DOM Manipulation,
Ajax / Axios / Eventbrite API

## Project Proposal B

Upon sign-in, The BTS Event Tracker allows users to create a personalized page that tracks events they have attended, future events for which they have purchased tickets, and events that they want to purchase tickets for.  NOTE:  This project is phase 1 of a multi-phase project that will eventually allow users to publish suggested events,  

* What problem or need does your project solve: builds more personalized and robust relationship between with riders and BTS, by encouraging them to visit for more than just ticket purchasing.

* Who are the users: BTS Bus Riders, past, present, and future.
